Upgrade notes:
===============

The upgrade path from Drupal 6 Paging module to Drupal 7 is underway, but it is
not done yet. For now, this file will serve as documentation between the
differences between the D6 and D7 versions of the modules.


Unsupported Features in D7:
----------------------------
- Paging separator string per content type.
  - in D7 one paging separator string will be set for the whole site.
- Page names will not be configurable.
- Page names interface removed.
- Ability to load pages in AJAX, removed.
- Paging separator widget selection removed.
- Pager style selection removed.



Upgrading from D6 to D7:
-------------------------
- Old separators will continue to work, as in D6.
  - After you choose a site-wide paging separator, node_save will parse and
    update any existing content to use the new global separator.
- Page names entered in D6 will be ignored.
- Paging separator widget will not be present.
- Pager style will revert to theme_pager().
